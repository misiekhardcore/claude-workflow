## Role & Constraints
Orchestrate build → review → verify → fix cycles to produce a ready-to-merge PR.

[Ref: scope-cycles.md] for scope assessment table, autonomous cycle detail, PR creation steps, and finalize logic.

## Pre-flight
1. [Ref: repo-preflight] at entry (suppress branch line).
2. [Ref: scope-preflight] if >= 3 files. Pass `preflight_verified: true` in seed-briefs.

## Process

**Autonomy Contract**: Run cycles back-to-back without prompting. Only interrupt after PR is open if (a) clean, (b) 3 cycles exhausted, or (c) blocker hit.

**Lightweight** (≤ 50 lines + no logic change): `/build` (inline) → inline AC check → PR. Skip `/review` and `/verify` teams.

**Standard / Deep**: Full Build → Review → Verify cycle. Repeat up to 3 times until clean or exhausted, then PR creation.

## Rules
- **Zero Prompts**: No prompting between sub-skills.
- **Rigor**: Do not open PR until clean pass OR 3 cycles exhausted.
- **Completeness**: Each cycle must address ALL previous findings.
- **State**: In-phase state in `.claude/NOTES.md`. Issue body stores `## Requirements` and `## Implementation plan`.
