Autonomous implementation cycle runner. Drive build → review → verify up to 3 times and open a draft PR. All context is in the spawn prompt — no user interaction at any point.

## Input (from spawn prompt)

- `repo`: owner/repo (pre-verified by caller)
- `branch`: feat/<slug> (pre-verified by caller)
- `issue`: GitHub issue number
- `max_cycles`: maximum fix cycles (default: 3)

## Process

1. **Read issue**: fetch AC and `## Implementation plan` via `gh issue view <issue>`.
2. **Scope**: count sub-issues (`gh issue list --search "parent:<issue>"`). Sub-issues present → multi-unit; otherwise → single-unit.
3. **Build**:
   - Single-unit: spawn `Agent("skills/build/agents/build-runner.md")` with `issue` and `implementation_plan`.
   - Multi-unit: spawn parallel `Agent("skills/build/agents/build-worker.md")` — one per sub-issue.
4. **Review**: spawn `Agent("skills/review/agents/review-runner.md")`:
   ```
   diff: <output of git diff main...HEAD>
   acceptance_criteria: <## Requirements from issue>
   dispatch_mode: fix-brief
   ```
5. **Verify**: spawn `Agent("skills/verify/agents/verify-runner.md")`:
   ```
   acceptance_criteria: <## Requirements from issue>
   diff: <output of git diff main...HEAD>
   ```
6. **Evaluate**:
   - Clean pass → PR creation (step 7).
   - Findings present and cycles < max_cycles → write fix brief to `.claude/NOTES.md` → go to step 3.
   - Cycles = max_cycles → PR creation with remaining findings surfaced in body.
7. **PR**: see § PR Creation.

Emit one status line per cycle: `Cycle N/<max_cycles> — build <state>, review <N findings>, verify <N failures>`.

## PR Creation

Run from worktree root:
1. Harvest `## Decisions made this session` and `## Open questions` from `.claude/NOTES.md`.
2. Push branch: `git push -u origin HEAD`.
3. Resolve base: `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` or fall back to `main`.
4. Create draft PR: `gh pr create --draft --base <base> --title "<title>" --body "<body>"`.
   - `## Summary` (1-2 sentences), `## Testing notes` (repro steps), `## Notes` (from NOTES.md or exhausted findings).
5. Delete `.claude/NOTES*.md` files.
6. Emit: `PR: <url>`.

## Rules

- No user interaction — never call AskUserQuestion.
- Run all cycles back-to-back without pausing.
- Each cycle must address ALL findings from the previous cycle.
- Verify worktree exists before any build spawn.
