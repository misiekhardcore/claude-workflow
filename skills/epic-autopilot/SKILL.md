You are orchestrating the autonomous epic-to-PR pipeline. Your goal is to take an epic GitHub issue (or free-text description) and produce a set of draft sub-PRs plus a top-level epic PR, with no human prompts after the per-sub-issue /define gates.

## Input

A single argument — either:

- **Positive integer** → treated as existing GitHub epic issue number. Parse: `int(arg) > 0`.
- **Any other string** → treated as free-text description; `/discovery` will create the epic issue.

## Scope Assessment

Always **Deep** — this is a fanout orchestrator. No inline path exists; the skill always spawns sub-agents.

### Spawn justification

Rubric: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/composition.md`.

- **Per-sub-issue /define gate**: sequential single-subagent per sub-issue. Model: sonnet. Fallback: n/a.
- **Autonomous phase — parallel Task sub-agents per tier**: one Task sub-agent per sub-issue within a tier, dispatched in a single message. Disjoint (each works on separate branch), parallel (tier-independent), payoff ≥3×. Model: opus per sub-agent. Fallback: sequential.

## Process

### Stage 0 — Resume detection

On every invocation, read the epic issue body and any sub-issue bodies first; consult the **Resume logic** table at the bottom to decide which stage to enter.

### Stage 1 — Discovery gate

If input is a positive integer and the epic issue has a well-formed `## Requirements` section (≥3 acceptance criteria), skip /discovery and go to Stage 2.

Otherwise:
1. Run `/discovery` on the epic (or free-text description). This is interactive.
2. **Pause for explicit user approval.** Present: "Discovery complete. Review the issue body above. Approve to continue to /define, or provide feedback."
3. Wait for explicit approval before proceeding.

### Stage 2 — Epic-level /define gate

1. Run `/define` on the epic issue. This is interactive — /define will produce architecture decisions, create sub-issues with linked-issue relationships, and update the issue body.
2. **Pause for explicit user approval.** Present: "Epic /define complete. Review the sub-issues and implementation plan above. Approve to continue to per-sub-issue /define, or provide feedback."
3. Wait for explicit approval.

After approval, read the epic issue body and extract the list of sub-issues. If `/define` produced **≤1 sub-issue**:
- Print: `Decomposition produced ≤1 sub-issue — running /implement directly on #<N>`
- Invoke `/implement` on the epic in the lead session (interactive, no `autonomous: true`).
- Exit.

### Stage 3 — Per-sub-issue /define gate

For each sub-issue in order (ascending issue number):

1. Check if this sub-issue already has `## Implementation plan` in its body. If yes, skip (already defined in prior run).
2. Spawn a fresh subagent to run `/define` on this sub-issue. Must finish before the next sub-issue's gate — these are sequential.
3. After the subagent returns, **pause for explicit user approval.** Present: "Sub-issue #<M> /define complete. Review the implementation plan above. Approve to continue to the next sub-issue, or provide feedback."
4. Wait for explicit approval before moving to next sub-issue.

Once every sub-issue has an approved `## Implementation plan`, proceed to **Stage 4 — Autonomous phase**. No further human prompts until exit.

### Stage 4 — Autonomous phase

**No human prompts from this point forward until exit.**

#### 4a. Epic branch creation

```
git checkout main && git pull
wt switch --create feat/epic-<N>
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: open epic #<N>"
git push -u origin feat/epic-<N>
```

The epic branch must exist and be pushed before any sub-task spawns.

#### 4b. Dependency-tier computation

Read each sub-issue body's `## Implementation plan` to extract the dependency graph. Build tiers using **Kahn's topological sort**:

1. Build adjacency: for each sub-issue M, parse its /define output for "depends on #<X>" references.
2. Compute in-degree for each node.
3. Tier 1 = nodes with in-degree 0. Assign to tier 1.
4. Remove tier-1 nodes; recompute in-degree. Tier 2 = new zero-in-degree nodes. Repeat until empty.
5. Ties within a tier: break by ascending sub-issue number.

**Cycle handling**: When Kahn's algorithm detects a cycle (zero-in-degree nodes exhaust while nodes remain with non-zero in-degree):

1. Among remaining nodes, pick the **highest-numbered** sub-issue `H`.
2. Among `H`'s declared dependencies, pick the **lowest-numbered** dependency `L`.
3. Drop `H`'s `depends on #L` declaration (decrement `H`'s in-degree).
4. Log to stdout: `Cycle broken: removed dep #<H> → #<L>`.
5. Resume Kahn's on modified graph.

**Branch base per sub-issue**:
- Tier-1 → base is `feat/epic-<N>`.
- Single-parent → base is that parent's branch.
- Multi-parent → base is the parent with lowest tier number; if multiple parents share lowest tier, choose **lowest-numbered** sub-issue among them. Document remaining parents in the sub-PR `## Notes` as manual merge steps.

#### 4c. Parallel Task dispatch — per tier

For each tier in ascending order:

1. **Before dispatching tier T**, verify every tier-T−1 sub-task has settled (PR open or FAILED). Tier 1 has no prerequisite.
2. Dispatch all sub-tasks in current tier as parallel `Task` sub-agents **in a single message**. For each sub-issue M:
   - Emit: `[sub-issue #<M>] dispatched (tier <T>)`
   - Create worktree for branch `feat/epic-<N>-sub-<M>` on base `<base-branch>`. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/worktree-protocol.md`.
   - Pass seed brief to sub-agent's `/implement` invocation. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/specialist-mode.md` with overrides:
     - `scope_class`: `Deep`
     - `branch`: `feat/epic-<N>-sub-<M>`
     - `active_issue`: `<M>`
     - `payload.prior_art`: `"Sub-issue #<M>'s ## Implementation plan (architecture and design decisions from /define)"`
     - `payload.open_questions`: unresolved constraints from /define for sub-issue #M, or empty

PR base is communicated via git upstream, not the brief. `/implement` detects it with `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u}` and passes `--base <detected>` to `gh pr create`.

3. Wait for all sub-agents in tier to settle before dispatching next tier.

#### 4d. Sub-task settlement and failure handling

Each sub-agent runs `/implement` end-to-end and attempts to open a draft PR. The `autonomous: true` flag suppresses `/implement`'s exhausted-exit prompt, so a draft PR (even exhausted-accepted) settles successfully.

After each sub-task settles, emit one status line:
- Clean exit: `[sub-issue #<M>] PR opened: <url> (cycles:<N>)`
- Exhausted-accepted: `[sub-issue #<M>] PR opened: <url> (cycles:3 [exhausted-accepted])`
- FAILED: `[sub-issue #<M>] FAILED — second retry exhausted`

If a sub-agent **aborts**, retry exactly once with same seed brief (emit `[sub-issue #<M>] RETRYING (attempt 2/2)`); if retry also aborts, mark FAILED and continue siblings.

#### 4e. Epic PR creation

After every sub-task across all tiers has settled (PR open or FAILED):

1. Push `feat/epic-<N>` to remote (empty commit pushed in 4a; push is no-op if already up-to-date).
2. Open a draft epic PR:

```
gh pr create --draft \
  --base main \
  --head feat/epic-<N> \
  --title "feat: epic #<N> — <epic title>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<1–3 sentences: what the epic delivers, which sub-issues are included>

## Sub-issues and sub-PRs

| Sub-issue | PR | Status |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| #<M> <title> | <PR url or FAILED> | <clean / exhausted-accepted / FAILED> |
...

## Merge order

Merge sub-PRs before the epic PR, in tier order. **GitHub does not auto-update child PR bases after a parent squash/rebase merge** — after each parent PR merges, update dependent branches manually.

## Follow-ups
<any FAILED sub-tasks, outstanding findings, or deferred work>

Closes #<N>
EOF
)"
```

3. Print epic PR URL and full sub-issue/sub-PR summary table to stdout.

### Stage 5 — Exit

Print exit summary to stdout and exit. The run is complete when all sub-PRs have been opened and the epic PR is open. Merging is left to humans.

## Resume logic

On re-invocation with the same epic issue number, epic-autopilot detects prior state and skips completed phases:

|State detected|Action|
|-|-|
|No `## Requirements` in epic body|Re-run from Stage 1|
|`## Requirements` but no `## Implementation plan`|Re-run from Stage 2|
|`## Implementation plan` present|Skip Stages 1–2; check sub-issues|
|Sub-issue has `## Implementation plan`|Skip per-sub-issue /define for that sub-issue|
|Sub-issue has open PR on its branch|Sub-task settled; skip|
|Sub-issue has branch but no PR|Re-run `/implement` in existing worktree|
|Sub-issue has neither branch nor PR|Fresh sub-task spawn|

A permanently-FAILED sub-task (branch exists, no PR, two prior retries) will be re-attempted on every resume. To skip it permanently, delete the branch and mark the sub-issue with a `skip` label before re-invoking.

## Rules

- Require explicit user approval at each gate (Stage 1, Stage 2, each Stage 3 sub-issue). Silence is not approval.
- The user must not modify the epic issue body or any sub-issue body during Stage 4. Sub-agents read at spawn time.
- Sub-issue branch and worktree names follow `feat/epic-<N>-sub-<M>` exactly. M is the globally unique GitHub sub-issue number.
- `autonomous: true` in the seed brief is reserved for sub-task spawns from this skill. Do not pass from other orchestrators.
- `/compound` and `/wrap-up` are not run by epic-autopilot — they remain user-invoked utilities.
- **Seed-brief contract**: See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/specialist-mode.md#Autonomous Implement Invocation`.
