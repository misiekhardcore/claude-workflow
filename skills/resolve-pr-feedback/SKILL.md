Process PR feedback end-to-end: Triage → Fix (parallel) → Reply → Compound.

Adopt `Skill("orchestrator-rules")` — use NOTES.md as progress ledger, checkpoint before every spawn,
seed-brief every agent, and no autonomous merge. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/seed-brief.md`
for seed-brief format and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/composition.md` for parallel-dispatch cost model.

## Input

- No argument: walk all unresolved threads on the current branch's PR via `gh pr view`.
- PR URL: walk all unresolved threads on the PR via `gh pr view`.
- Thread URL: extract `owner/repo/number` and filter to matching `databaseId`.

## Worker Agent Inventory

### fix-agent
**File**: `agents/fix-agent.md`
**Spawn**: `Agent("skills/resolve-pr-feedback/agents/fix-agent.md")` — one per disjoint file group, in parallel. See agent file for seed-brief I/O contract.

## Process

### Phase 1 — Fetch
1. Resolve PR owner/repo/number from URL or `gh pr view`.
2. Fetch threads via GraphQL (`isResolved` state), filter bots/approvals/CI.
3. If URL arg provided, match `databaseId`.

### Phase 2 — Triage
1. Classify each thread:
   - **Status**: `new` | `already-handled` (check diff).
   - **Category**: `error-handling` | `validation` | `type-safety` | `naming` | `performance` | `testing` | `security` | `docs` | `style` | `architecture`.
2. Group by category → present triage summary to user; allow override.
3. Map threads to files for conflict avoidance (no two agents on same file).

### Phase 3 — Fix (Parallel per file group)
1. Build seed-brief per file group from triage mapping.
2. Checkpoint NOTES.md.
3. Spawn one `Agent("skills/resolve-pr-feedback/agents/fix-agent.md")` per file group with seed-brief (see Worker Agent I/O contract above).
4. Each fix-agent: read context → apply fix → verify → commit → report verdict.
5. After all return: run full test suite for regression check.
6. Collect verdicts; update NOTES.md.

### Phase 4 — Reply (main thread)
1. Read `references/verdicts.md` for verdict/reply mapping and mutation rules.
2. For each thread, draft reply based on verdict and commit SHA.
3. Post replies via `gh api .../replies`.
4. Resolve threads where verdict in `{fixed, fixed-differently, not-addressing}`.
5. Verify: `gh pr view <N> --json reviewThreads` — confirm all resolved.

### Phase 5 — Compound
After all phases complete cleanly: invoke `Skill("compound")` to capture session
learnings. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/compound-on-exit.md` — exactly once,
clean completion only.

## Output
Summary: total threads → counts per verdict → commits created → threads needing human attention.

## Rules
- Additive only — no force-push or history rewrite.
- Read full thread, not just last comment.
- Flag fixes outside PR scope.
- Each logical fix as separate commit referencing thread.
- Checkpoint NOTES.md before every `Agent()` spawn (see orchestrator-rules § Progress tracking).
- No `context: fork` — worker agents run as `Agent()` in isolated background sessions.
