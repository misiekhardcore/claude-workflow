Process PR feedback end-to-end: Triage → Fix (parallel) → Reply → Compound.

Adopt `Skill("orchestrator-rules")` — use NOTES.md as progress ledger, checkpoint before every spawn, seed-brief every agent, and no autonomous merge. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/seed-brief.md` for seed-brief format and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/composition.md` for parallel-dispatch cost model.

## Input

- No argument: walk all unresolved threads on the current branch's PR via `gh pr view`.
- PR URL: walk all unresolved threads on the PR via `gh pr view`.
- Thread URL: extract `owner/repo/number` and filter to matching `databaseId`.

## Process

### Phase 1 — Fetch
1. Resolve PR owner/repo/number from URL or `gh pr view`.
2. Fetch threads via GraphQL (`isResolved` state), filter bots/approvals/CI.
3. If URL arg provided, match `databaseId`.

### Phase 2 — Triage
1. Classify each thread:
   - **Status**: `new` | `already-handled` (check diff).
   - **Category**: `error-handling` | `validation` | `type-safety` | `naming` | `performance` | `testing` | `security` | `docs` | `style` | `architecture`.
2. Map threads to files and group by category → present triage summary to user; allow override.

### Phase 3 — Fix (Parallel per file group)
1. Group affected files into non-overlapping sets.
2. Build seed-brief per file group from triage mapping.
3. Checkpoint NOTES.md.
4. Spawn one `Agent("agents/workflow-fix-agent.md")` per file group with seed-brief (see Worker Agent I/O contract above).
5. After all return: run full test suite for regression check.
6. Collect verdicts; update NOTES.md.

### Phase 4 — Reply
1. For each thread, draft reply based on verdict and commit SHA:
   - `fixed`: draft a reply citing the fix and commit SHA.
   - `already-handled`: draft a reply explaining the existing behavior addresses the comment.
   - `needs-human`: draft a reply explaining what was attempted and why it needs human review.
2. Keep the reply concise and factual (2-4 sentences).
3. Post replies via `gh api .../replies`.
4. Resolve threads where verdict in `{fixed, fixed-differently, not-addressing}`.
5. Verify: `gh pr view <N> --json reviewThreads` — confirm all resolved.

### Phase 5 — Compound
After all phases complete cleanly: invoke `Skill("compound")` to capture session learnings. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/compound-on-exit.md` — exactly once, clean completion only.

## Output
Summary: total threads → counts per verdict → commits created → threads needing human attention.

## Rules
- Additive only — no force-push or history rewrite.
- Read full thread, not just last comment.
- Flag fixes outside PR scope.
- Each logical fix as separate commit referencing thread.
