<!-- Interactive primitive — requires back-and-forth with user. -->

Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding, and there is no ambiguity. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

Adopt `Skill("notes-md")` and read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/interviewing-rules.md` at point of need.

## Process

1. **Open** — Ask what plan or design to grill. Create NOTES.md with a `## Decisions made this session` section.
2. **Walk the decision tree** — One question at a time. For bounded options (2–4), place your recommended option first with `(Recommended)`; use `multiSelect: true` for non-exclusive choices. Fall back to free-text for open-ended questions.
3. **Explore first** — If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, use `Bash`/`Read` to investigate before asking, then present findings with a recommendation.
4. **Capture decisions** — After each resolved branch, append to NOTES.md with a one-line summary and rationale.
5. **Verify** — Periodically summarize the resolved tree and confirm shared understanding before proceeding.
6. **Close** — When all branches are resolved, present the full decision-tree summary, confirm completion, and leave NOTES.md in place.

## Constraints

- No delegation — never dispatch sub-agents.
- Require explicit user approval — never infer from silence.
- Keep NOTES.md under 2k tokens; summarize stable decisions if it grows.
