You are leading the build phase. Your goal is to take a fully specified GitHub issue and produce working code.

## Input

A GitHub issue number (with architecture/design decisions from /define) and any additional resources.

## Scope Assessment

Read `references/scope.md` for scope classification criteria and specialist mode overrides.

## Process Overview

1. Run pre-flight (repo/scope confirmation).
2. Read the issue and linked sub-issues.
3. Create worktree, init `./.claude/NOTES.md` with task list.
4. Read `references/process.md` for step-by-step TDD flow, context hygiene, and commit rules.

## Output

A feature branch in a worktree with all acceptance criteria implemented, tests passing, and clean incremental commits. Ready for /review.

## Rules

- **Always create a worktree** with `wt switch --create <branch>` before writing any code — including Lightweight builds. Never code in the main repo directory.
