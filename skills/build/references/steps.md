# Build Skill — Scope Assessment & Process Details

## Scope Assessment

Classify the build per criteria below:

|Scope|Criteria|Team|
|-|-|-|
|Single work unit|Single-file or tightly scoped; AC fits one module; no sub-issues|Code inline, no team|
|Few work units|2–3 natural work splits (sub-issues or distinct file groups)|Implementation team, one agent per split|
|Many work units|Many sub-issues, cross-module work, or architecture-changing scope|Parallel subagents; lead coordinates and merges results|

### Decision Tree

Invoke `Skill("scope-assessment")` with work units derived from sub-issues and file groups. The output determines agent count and spawn primitive.

### Spawn Justification

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/composition.md` for spawn cost models.

- **Few work units** (2–3): parallel subagents, one per unit.
- **Many work units** (4+): parallel subagents; lead coordinates and merges results.

## Specialist Mode

When invoked by `/implement` with a `<seed-brief>` block, skip:
- repo-preflight (already run; `preflight_verified: true` in brief)
- scope-preflight

Always keep: the design gate — architecture decisions must be verified cross-phase even when seeded.

Invoke `Skill("specialist-mode")`.

## Process Steps

### Step 0 — Pre-flight

Invoke `Skill("preflight")`.
Confirmation prompt: "Does this match the repo and branch you intend to work on?"

### Step 1 — Issue Review

Read the issue, all comments, and linked sub-issues to understand the full scope.

### Step 2 — Git Worktree & Task List

Create a git worktree (`wt switch --create`). Worktrees keep the main workspace clean and let teammates operate in isolation. Single-unit builds still use a worktree.

Before creating `./.claude/NOTES.md`, verify `/.claude/NOTES.md` is listed in `.gitignore` at repo root; add if missing. Create `./.claude/NOTES.md` with the initial task list harvested from the issue. This is the living worklog — it survives unexpected session close.

Reference: Invoke `Skill("notes-md")`.

### Step 3 — Spawn Workers

Spawn workers per scope-assessment output (single unit: inline; multi-unit: parallel subagents).

The lead merges results from all subagents. Coordinate via the shared task list.

### Step 4 — Test-Driven Development

Each teammate follows **test-driven development (TDD)** for logic-heavy code:
- Write failing test first — derive from acceptance criteria.
- Implement until test passes — minimal code.
- Refactor — clean up while tests stay green.
- Skip TDD for pure boilerplate/wiring.

### Step 5 — Verify Before Marking Done

Run `superpowers:verification-before-completion` after each task. Mandatory; fix any gaps before committing.

### Step 6 — Simplify as You Go

After every 2-3 task completions, scan for obvious duplication, dead code, or consolidation opportunities in touched files. Not a full refactor — just fast low-hanging fruit. If found, create a micro-task to consolidate before proceeding.

### Step 7 — Context Hygiene

Keep context focused. Trigger on **concept shifts**, not percentages:
- Stale tool results after work has moved on → clear with context editing.
- About to read a large file or grep wide → delegate to sub-agent that returns focused report.
- About to start a new sub-issue or just spawned a sub-agent → natural reset.
- If `/compact` is unavoidable: flush working set into `./.claude/NOTES.md`, emit `Keep: / Drop:` note, run `/compact`, diff post-compaction summary against Keep list in `./.claude/NOTES.md` before next tool call.

Invoke `Skill("compaction-protocol")`. Context editing first, sub-agents second, `/compact` last.

### Step 8 — Incremental Commits & Notes

Commit changes incrementally using semantic messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`). Update `./.claude/NOTES.md` after each completed task — resume point if session dies.

## Output

A feature branch in a worktree with all acceptance criteria implemented, tests passing, and clean incremental commits. Ready for /review.

## Rules

- Use `superpowers:test-driven-development` for the TDD workflow.
- Use `wt switch --create` / `wt remove` for worktree management.
- Pick the spawn primitive per scope-assessment output. Single-unit builds code inline.
- Do not ask the user whether to use parallel agents — pick the scope and go. Pick inline / subagents based on the scope-assessment output.
- Do not open a PR — that happens after /implement completes the full cycle.
- Always run the 5-question verification check before marking a task done.
- Consolidation scans are lightweight — spend seconds, not minutes.
- Context hygiene is a build-time responsibility — trigger on concept shifts, not percentages. Trigger `/compact` automatically at concept shifts; delegate bulk I/O to sub-agents before context overruns.
- `./.claude/NOTES.md` is authoritative for in-flight state; if your recall disagrees, trust the file.
