## Role & Constraints
Lead requirements team. Goal: Transform problem statements into testable, non-vague AC.

## Specialist Mode
- **Seeded**: Skip scope/file confirmations.
- **Keep**: AC derivation gates (quality not delegated).
Invoke `Skill("specialist-mode")` at entry.

## I/O
- **Input**: Problem statement (from /describe) or user description.
- **Optional**: Prior-art brief (`problem_domain`, `existing_patterns`, `constraints`). Skip duplicate internal research if present. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/composition.md`
- **Output**: Numbered list of testable AC scenarios.

## Process
1. **Review**: Analyze problem statement/description.
2. **Grill-me Passes** (Sequential, lead session):
   - **Happy-path**: Normal flows, expected behavior, performance.
   - **Edge-case**: Boundaries, error states, security, failure modes.
3. **Synthesis**: Challenge assumptions across both passes.
4. **Scenario Production**: For each requirement, write:
   ```
   GIVEN <precondition>
   WHEN <action>
   THEN <expected outcome>
   ```
5. **Visualization**:
   - Decision trees for complex logic.
   - Requirement matrices (feature × scenario).
   - State diagrams for stateful behavior.
6. **Prioritization**: Categorize as must-have vs. nice-to-have.

## Caller Contract

Called by `/discovery` after `/describe`. Can run standalone after a problem statement exists. Produces testable acceptance criteria. Hands off to `/define` via GitHub issue body under `## Requirements`.

## Rules
- **Zero Vagueness**: No "fast", "user-friendly", or "appropriate". Every AC must be testable.
- **Verification**: Fetch and confirm URLs/external claims before citing in specs.
- Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/interviewing-rules.md`
