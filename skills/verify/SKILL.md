## Role & Constraints
Lead verification phase. Goal: Verify every AC from the issue is met with evidence.

## Specialist Mode
- **Seeded**: Skip repo-preflight.
- **Keep**: AC verification rigor (pass/fail evidence is never delegated).
- [Ref: specialist-mode]

## I/O
- **Input**: Branch + GitHub issue number.
- **Verification Package** (Sole input to teammates):
  - Diff (`git diff main...HEAD`)
  - AC (`gh issue view <number>`)
  - Test commands (type-check, lint, unit, build, e2e)
- **Output**: QA report (Pass/fail per AC with evidence, verification chain results, issues found).

## Scope Assessment
|Scope|Criteria|Action|
|-|-|-|
|**Lightweight**|<= 3 AC, simple repros, no security/perf|Lead verifies inline. No team.|
|**Standard**|>= 4 AC, or spans multiple areas/files|QA team with AC split across teammates.|
|**Deep**|Security-sensitive, perf-critical, migration|QA team + specialist QA (Security or Performance).|

**Decision**: <= 3 AC + 1-module diff → Lightweight; Auth/Security/Migrations/Perf-paths → Deep; else → Standard.

### Spawn Rubric [Ref: composition]
- **Standard/Deep**: `TeamCreate` at >= 4 AC, else parallel subagents. Model: `haiku`.

## Process

### Lightweight
1. Extract AC from issue.
2. Run verification chain (step 4).
3. Walk each AC → report pass/fail with evidence.

### Standard / Deep
1. Extract AC from issue.
2. **Dispatch QA Verifiers**: Split AC across workers → each receives only the Verification Package.
3. **Deep Only**: Add specialist worker matched to diff (Security/Perf).
4. **Execution**: Teammates use `superpowers:verification-before-completion` → verify end-to-end → report pass/fail with evidence.
5. **Verification Chain**:
   - Type-check (`tsc --noEmit`) → Lint → Unit tests → Build → E2E/Browser tests.
6. **Convergence**: Discuss edge cases → unified QA report.

## Rules
- **Separation**: Never fix issues during verification.
- **Evidence-Based**: No "it works" — every criterion needs evidence.
- **Feedback Loop**: Any failure → report goes back to `/build` for fixes.
- **Isolation**: Never forward build-session history to QA teammates.
