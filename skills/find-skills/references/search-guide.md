# How to Help Users Find Skills

## Step 1: Understand What They Need

When a user asks for help with something, identify:

1. The domain (e.g., React, testing, design, deployment)
2. The specific task (e.g., writing tests, creating animations, reviewing PRs)
3. Whether this is a common enough task that a skill likely exists

## Step 2: Dispatch a Discovery Sub-agent

Delegate steps 3–4 (leaderboard check + CLI search) to a research sub-agent. Pass: query terms derived from step 1, the user's stated goal. The sub-agent returns a list of candidate skills with one-line summaries, install counts, and source reputations. The main thread handles install confirmation and execution.

Sub-agent spawn prompt must start with:
```
cd <cwd> && pwd  # verify CWD — sub-agents do not inherit parent CWD
```

## Step 3: Check the Leaderboard First (sub-agent)

Before running a CLI search, check the [skills.sh leaderboard](https://skills.sh/) to see if a well-known skill already exists for the domain. The leaderboard ranks skills by total installs, surfacing the most popular and battle-tested options.

For example, top skills for web development include:
- `vercel-labs/agent-skills` — React, Next.js, web design (100K+ installs each)
- `anthropics/skills` — Frontend design, document processing (100K+ installs)

## Step 4: Search for Skills (sub-agent)

If the leaderboard doesn't cover the user's need, run the find command:

```bash
npx skills find [query]
```

For example:

- User asks "how do I make my React app faster?" → `npx skills find react performance`
- User asks "can you help me with PR reviews?" → `npx skills find pr review`
- User asks "I need to create a changelog" → `npx skills find changelog`

## Step 5: Verify Quality Before Recommending (sub-agent)

**Do not recommend a skill based solely on search results.** Always verify:

1. **Install count** — Prefer skills with 1K+ installs. Be cautious with anything under 100.
2. **Source reputation** — Official sources (`vercel-labs`, `anthropics`, `microsoft`) are more trustworthy than unknown authors.
3. **GitHub stars** — Check the source repository. A skill from a repo with <100 stars should be treated with skepticism.

## Step 6: Present Options to the User (main thread)

When the sub-agent returns candidate skills, present them to the user with:

1. The skill name and what it does
2. The install count and source
3. The install command they can run
4. A link to learn more at skills.sh

Example response:

```
I found a skill that might help! The "react-best-practices" skill provides
React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering.
(185K installs)

To install it:
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills@react-best-practices

```

## Step 7: Offer to Install (main thread)

If the user wants to proceed, install the skill:

```bash
npx skills add <owner/repo@skill> -g -y
```

The `-g` flag installs globally (user-level) and `-y` skips confirmation prompts.
