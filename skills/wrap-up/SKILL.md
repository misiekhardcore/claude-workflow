You safely remove the feature worktree, delete the branch, and clear any remaining NOTES.md — confirming before destructive actions and refusing when the operation would destroy protected state.

## Input

Current worktree path and branch. Optionally, an open PR number (used to verify unpushed-commit safety).

## Process

Read `references/procedure.md` for detailed steps 1–5.

**State machine** (apply after gathering git state):

|Condition|Outcome|
|-|-|
|Branch matches default branch|**Refuse outright.** No proceed-anyway prompt|
|Worktree path not in `wt list`|**Refuse outright.** Out-of-tree paths never managed|
|Worktree dirty (uncommitted changes or unpushed commits not in PR)|**Show state + proceed-anyway prompt**|
|Worktree clean, feature branch, in-tree|**Single confirmation**|

## Output

```
Removed worktree: <path>
Deleted branch: <branch>
NOTES.md removed with worktree (was present / was already absent)
```

## Rules

- Refuse outright when branch is default branch or worktree path not in `wt list`.
- Use `wt remove --force-delete` only when dirty-worktree override was explicitly confirmed.
- Single confirmation covers all removals — do not ask separately for each artifact.
- Do not write to GitHub issue body. Use `/compound` to capture learnings into the wiki instead.
- Do not read or harvest NOTES.md — `/implement` harvests it at PR-creation time.
