NOTES.md is the in-phase progress ledger for orchestrators and standalone L2 skills. Read the shared reference for the full protocol spec.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/notes-md-protocol.md` for the complete lifecycle, checkpoint pattern, and seed-brief slice rules.

## Behavioral Protocol

1. **Create on entry** — On phase entry (after preflight), create `.claude/NOTES.md` with a task list.
2. **Checkpoint before spawn** — Before every `Skill()` or `Agent()` call, write `## Current task` and `## Next action on resume`.
3. **Update after return** — After a sub-agent returns, read NOTES.md, integrate results, update task list.
4. **Clean up on exit** — On phase exit, leave NOTES.md in place for the next skill to harvest (or clean up if terminal).
