# Orchestrator Rules — Shared Protocol

Rules that apply to all pipeline orchestrators (`/issue-autopilot`, `/epic-autopilot`).

## CWD verification

Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/repo-preflight.md` at entry. Echo resolved `owner/repo` before every downstream cross-repo `gh` mutation. Pass `preflight_verified: true` in seed briefs so sub-skills skip redundant preflights.

## Delegation

Each stage delegates to the designated sub-skill. Do not reimplement logic owned by `/implement`, `/resolve-pr-feedback`, `/compound`, `/wrap-up`, or any other sub-skill.

## No autonomous merge

Merging is always a human action. Exit cleanly at the awaiting-merge stage; never trigger a merge.

## Seed-brief contract

See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/specialist-mode.md` § Autonomous Implement Invocation.
