# NOTES.md — In-Phase Memory Tier

`.claude/NOTES.md` is rot-immune external memory for in-phase state. Read on-demand when creating, updating, or harvesting; do not preload.

## Where it sits in the memory hierarchy

Four tiers:

|Tier|Where|Lifetime|Authoritative for|
|-|-|-|-|
|`TodoWrite`|In-context|This session|Throwaway scratchpad|
|`.claude/NOTES.md`|Worktree-local, gitignored|This phase, across sessions|In-flight decisions, task progress, current task, open questions|
|GitHub issue|Remote|Cross-phase|Acceptance criteria, prior-phase decisions, handoff state|
|Durable vault|claude-obsidian vault (git-tracked)|Durable, cross-feature|Patterns, bug-fix history, architectural insights|

Do not mirror `TodoWrite` and `.claude/NOTES.md` — they serve different roles. The vault tier materializes when `claude-obsidian` is installed; without it, skills that would write degrade gracefully.

## NOTES.md vs the vault's recency channels

|Artifact|Scope|Lifetime|Committed?|
|-|-|-|-|
|`.claude/NOTES.md`|One worktree, one feature|Ends when worktree removed|No (gitignored)|
|Vault hot cache|Whole repo, all work|Cross-session, curated|Yes|
|Session archive|One session|Permanent|Yes|
|Vault log|Whole repo|Permanent, append-only|Yes|

- **While working** — log to `.claude/NOTES.md` (phase-local scratch).
- **Between sessions on same feature** — resume from `.claude/NOTES.md` (authoritative in-flight state).
- **Between features** — promote durable learnings to vault via `/compound`. That crosses the worktree boundary.
- **For recent context across repo** — use vault's hot cache (curated, committed), not NOTES.md (raw, ephemeral).

`/implement` is the harvest point: at PR creation it reads NOTES.md, flows the decisions and open questions into the PR body, then deletes NOTES.md after `/compound` has run.

## Location and lifecycle

- **Path:** `<worktree-root>/.claude/NOTES.md`.
- **Created by the agent that starts the phase** — either an orchestrator (L1) or a standalone skill (L2 like `/build`).
- **Ownership transfers with execution.** The running agent always owns NOTES.md. An orchestrator owns it before spawn and after return; the spawned sub-skill owns it during execution. Since execution is sequential (spawn → wait → return), there is no concurrent write conflict.
- **Updated by the currently running agent** after each completed task, significant decision, or before spawning a further sub-agent (checkpoint). This applies equally to orchestrators and spawned sub-skills.
- **Read on resume** — before re-reading the issue, reconstruct state from NOTES.md.
- **Harvested by `/implement`** at PR-creation time. `## Decisions made this session` and `## Open questions` flow into PR body's `## Notes` section.
- **Deleted by `/implement`** after `/compound` runs. If `/implement` exits abnormally, NOTES.md persists; `/wrap-up` cleans it up with worktree removal.
- **Left in place** by standalone skills — cleanup happens when worktree is removed.
- **Not committed to git.** Ensure `/.claude/NOTES.md` is gitignored; add entry if missing.

## Required sections

`.claude/NOTES.md` is a bullet list, not prose. Keep the whole file readable in one screen — it should cost <1k tokens to re-read.

```markdown
# NOTES — feat/<feature-slug>

## Current task
- <the one thing you are working on right now>

## Task list
- [x] <done task>
- [ ] <pending or in-progress task — first unchecked item is the current one>
- [!] <blocked task — with reason>

## Decisions made this session
- <one-line decision> (why: <rationale>)
- ...

## Open questions
- <question that needs the user or next phase to resolve>

## Next action on resume
- <exact command or file to open if the session dies>
```

## Update cadence

Update at these points (bullet-level only):

- **After each completed task** — flip checkbox, log any decision.
- **After each significant decision** — one line with rationale.
- **Before any `/compact`** — write Keep list first, so post-compaction summary can be diffed against external record.
- **Before ending session normally** — `/implement` harvests at PR-creation time.

Don't update for trivial moves (opening file, running test). Checkpoint log, not transcript.

## Resume protocol

When `.claude/NOTES.md` exists in worktree, it's a resume:

1. Read `./.claude/NOTES.md` first.
2. Read the GitHub issue second (cross-phase decisions and acceptance criteria).
3. Resume from **Next action on resume**, or from first unchecked item in Task list if stale.
4. Update **Current task** and **Next action on resume** before first real action.

## Standalone skill pattern

A standalone L2 skill (e.g. `/build` invoked directly by the user, not by an orchestrator) uses NOTES.md as a lightweight progress tracker:

1. **Create** — On entry, create NOTES.md with `## Task list`, `## Decisions made this session`, and `## Next action on resume`.
2. **Update** — Flip checkboxes as tasks complete, log decisions, update `## Current task` and `## Next action on resume` at each natural breakpoint.
3. **Leave** — On exit, leave NOTES.md in place. Do not delete.

No checkpoint-before-spawn is needed — standalone skills do not spawn sub-agents. The pattern is create → update → leave.

## Orchestrator checkpoint pattern

Orchestrators use NOTES.md as the progress ledger for multi-step pipelines that delegate to sub-agents. The pattern:

1. **Create** — On entry (after preflight), create NOTES.md with the full task list derived from work units.
2. **Checkpoint before sub-agent spawn** — Write `## Current task` (what the sub-agent will do) and `## Next action on resume` (how to reconstruct if session dies) before every `Skill()` or `Agent()` call. This ensures crash-safe resume.
3. **Update after sub-agent returns** — The sub-skill may have written its own progress, decisions, and task updates to NOTES.md while it ran. Read the file, integrate its results, flip checkboxes, and log any new decisions. The orchestrator's view is authoritative for the overall pipeline; the sub-skill's entries are intermediate working state.
4. **Wrap-up** — On clean exit, leave NOTES.md in place for `/implement` to harvest. On abnormal exit, NOTES.md serves as the resume point.

### Seed-brief slice

When spawning a sub-agent, include a relevant slice of NOTES.md in the seed-brief payload so the agent arrives with progress context:

```
<seed-brief>
...
payload:
  type: research
  progress: |
    ## Task list (relevant)
    - [x] Scope assessment → 3 work units
    - [ ] Build specialist (current)
    - [ ] Review specialist

    ## Decisions made this session
    - Split auth into own work unit (why: security isolation)
  open_questions: ""
</seed-brief>
```

Slice rules:
- Include only the subset of `## Task list` relevant to the spawned agent's scope.
- Include `## Decisions made this session` in full (decisions are global to the phase).
- Omit `## Current task` (the agent will set its own).
- Cap at 15 lines — the brief is not a state dump.

## Rules

- **NOTES.md is authoritative for in-flight state.** Trust the file; in-context recall is rot-degraded.
- **Issue is authoritative for cross-phase state.** Acceptance criteria, locked decisions, prior-phase handoff live in issue, not file.
- **Ownership transfers with the running agent.** The agent currently executing owns NOTES.md — whether that's the orchestrator or a spawned sub-skill. On return, ownership passes back to the caller.
- **Orchestrator checkpoints before every spawn** so NOTES.md contains enough state to reconstruct if the session dies mid-spawn (sub-skill never started or partially executed).
- **Sub-skills use NOTES.md for their own multi-step tracking** while they run (same sections, same conventions). This is safe because execution is sequential — no concurrent writers.
- **Deletion is `/implement`'s responsibility.** It deletes after `/compound` runs. Standalone skills leave in place.
