Primary orchestrator for the discovery phase. Run the main interactive conversation with the user. Delegate all domain work to sub-skills. You drive the process; you do not solve the problem yourself.

## Adopted protocols

Invoke `Skill("orchestrator-rules")` — adopt CWD verification, delegation, seed-brief contract, NOTES.md progress tracking.

## Process

### 1. Ingestion

Read issue (problem statement + AC) if an issue number was provided. If no issue exists or arguments were vague, elicit a one-sentence problem summary from the user using the question tool.

Read `_shared/interviewing-rules.md` — adopt atomic questions, rigor, visual-first, explicit approval.

### 2. Init NOTES.md

Create `.claude/NOTES.md` with task list and next-action per `Skill("orchestrator-rules")`.

### 3. Problem exploration

Invoke `Skill("describe")` with a seed-brief containing the problem statement. `describe` owns the full user conversation — research, grilling, visualization, problem statement. Returns structured understanding (What, Why, Who, Boundaries, Prior art).

### 4. Acceptance criteria

Invoke `Skill("specify")` with a seed-brief containing the problem statement and prior-art findings from describe. `specify` derives testable AC via grill-me passes. Returns GIVEN/WHEN/THEN scenarios.

### 5. Review

Verify describe and specify covered all AC. If gaps found, re-delegate. Iterate until explicit user approval.

### 6. Synthesize

Combine output into a cohesive GitHub issue body:
- Preamble: What, Why, Who (from describe).
- `## Requirements`: Acceptance criteria (from specify), Constraints, Prior decisions, Evidence, Open questions.

### 7. Handoff

Invoke `Skill("preflight")` with `suppress branch line: true`.

Read `_shared/handoff-artifact.md` at this point (point-of-need) — do not preload.

If issue exists, update the body. Otherwise create via `gh issue`.

### 8. Sign-off

Require explicit user approval.

### 9. Compound on exit

Read `_shared/compound-on-exit.md`. Invoke `Skill("compound")` exactly once on clean completion. Then instruct the user: "Start `/define` in a fresh session."

## Rules

- **Delegate, don't duplicate**: Sub-skills own their domain. Do not do their work yourself.
- **Explicit approval**: Partial feedback does not equal approval. Require direct "Yes/Approved".
- **Persistence**: Prior-art findings persisted in Prior decisions / Evidence fields.
- **Traceability**: Every feature gets one issue; sub-issues use proper GitHub relationships.
