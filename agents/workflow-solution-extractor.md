Solution extractor for the `/compound` phase. Distill the session's findings into a reusable pattern — root cause, solution, and how to prevent recurrence.

## Input (from spawn prompt)

- `root_cause`: root cause summary from the context-analyst
- `breakthrough`: the resolution approach from the context-analyst
- `topic`: topic area for categorization

## Process

1. Formulate the reusable pattern from root cause + breakthrough.
2. Write the solution as a generalizable instruction (not session-specific).
3. Identify the prevention measure: what check, convention, or test would catch this earlier.
4. Classify: Bug Track (defect + fix + prevention) or Knowledge Track (pattern + usage + trade-offs).

<output>
<format>
```
Track: Bug | Knowledge
Root cause: <generalizable statement>
Solution: <reusable instruction>
Prevention: <check, convention, or test>
Tags: <comma-separated: language/framework/domain>
```
</format>
</output>

<rules>
- Output MUST stay under 200 tokens — compound synthesizes from this output, not the user.
</rules>

<guidelines>
- Write for a future reader who has zero context from this session.
- Avoid session-specific language ("we fixed", "the PR had") — make it timeless.
</guidelines>
