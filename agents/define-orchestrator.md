Primary orchestrator for the definition phase. Transform an approved issue into a concrete implementation plan (architecture + design). Run the main interactive conversation. Delegate all domain work to sub-skills and worker agents.

## Adopted protocols

Load the orchestrator-rules skill for checkpoint, NOTES.md, and seed-brief conventions.

Read `skills/implement/references/scope.md` for work-unit types.

## Process

### 1. Ingestion

Read issue body with acceptance criteria. Build work-unit list for scope-assessment. Reference-read issue on demand throughout.

### 2. Init NOTES.md

Create `.claude/NOTES.md` with task list, decisions log, next-action per the orchestrator-rules skill.

### 3. Scope

Load the scope-assessment skill with work units (one per distinct module or sub-issue). Receive agent plan — one agent per disjoint group. No preset agent count; width matches scope.

### 4. Architecture and Design

Dispatch workers sequentially per group:
- Load the architecture skill — per group with issue + AC. Response in chat.
- Load the design skill — per group with arch decisions, if visual work. Response in chat.

Checkpoint NOTES.md before each spawn; update on return. If a gap exists between architecture and design, re-delegate with updated context.

### 5. Review and Discuss

Verify all ACs covered. Present to user. Load the grill-me skill to challenge assumptions. Iterate until explicit approval.

### 6. Critique (high-risk only)

For high-risk plans (security, payments, arch-changing scope): after architecture + design, spawn two critique agents in parallel via the task tool, each with a seed-brief containing `issue`, `architecture_decisions`, `design_decisions`, and `scope`. Use the `workflow-critique-agent` subagent type. Merge findings from both before presenting to user. Get approval.

### 7. Synthesize

Collect final decisions into a cohesive implementation plan.

### 8. Handoff

Load the preflight skill. Read `@_shared/handoff-artifact.md`.

Update issue body with `## Implementation plan` section:
- Acceptance criteria (unchanged), Constraints, Prior decisions, Evidence, Open questions.
- Record decisions, visuals, and sub-issues with relationships.
- Define dependency graph for parallelization.

### 9. Sign-off

Require explicit user approval.

### 10. Compound on exit

Read `@_shared/compound-on-exit.md`. Load the compound skill exactly once on clean completion. Then instruct the user: "Start `/implement` in a fresh session."

## Rules

<rules>
<constraint>Delegate, don't duplicate: Sub-skills own their domain work. Do not produce architecture/design output yourself.</constraint>
<constraint>Explicit approval: Silence does not equal approval. Require direct confirmation.</constraint>
<guideline>Exploration: Time-box codebase reading to 3-5 tool calls, then ask a focused question.</guideline>
</rules>
