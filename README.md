# claude-workflow

Workflow skills plugin for Claude Code — a standardized lifecycle for feature development.

                   draft PR + /compound
```

## Install

This repo is its own marketplace — the plugin and marketplace manifests both live in `.claude-plugin/`, so a single `marketplace add` points Claude Code at both.

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add misiekhardcore/claude-workflow
claude plugin install claude-workflow@claude-workflow
```

Then enable it in your project or globally in Claude Code settings.

## Prerequisites

Skills that spawn parallel sub-agents (`/discovery`, `/define`, `/implement`, and others that use `TeamCreate`) require:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
```

Without this flag, `TeamCreate` is unavailable. Skills detect its absence and fall back to sequential execution, noting the degraded mode explicitly.

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/discovery` | Explore a problem and produce a GitHub issue with acceptance criteria |
| `/define` | Plan architecture and design; produces the implementation handoff |
| `/implement` | Full build→review→verify cycle, ends with a draft PR |
| `/build` | Code against an issue's acceptance criteria using TDD |
| `/review` | Review an implementation; correctness, standards, and conditional specialists |
| `/verify` | QA verification of every acceptance criterion |
| `/describe` | Explore and understand a problem space interactively |
| `/specify` | Turn a problem statement into testable acceptance criteria |
| `/architecture` | Decide on technical architecture — components, data flow, trade-offs |
| `/design` | Visual and UX design decisions — layouts, interaction flows |
| `/grill-me` | Relentless interviewing to stress-test a plan or design |
| `/compound` | Capture learnings as structured wiki notes; files via `claude-obsidian` when installed, otherwise reports inline |
| `/wrap-up` | End-of-session audit; harvests NOTES.md into the issue body |
| `/prune` | Audit CLAUDE.md for staleness; delegates vault audit to `wiki-lint` when `claude-obsidian` is installed |
| `/find-skills` | Discover and install skills from the ecosystem |
| `/resolve-pr-feedback` | Process PR review feedback in bulk |
| `/new-skill` | Scaffold a new skill conforming to this authoring standard |

## Optional: claude-obsidian integration

claude-workflow doesn't ship its own knowledge store. When the [claude-obsidian](https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-obsidian) plugin is installed and a vault has been bootstrapped (`/wiki`), several skills light up vault-aware paths automatically:

- `/compound` files captures via `/save` instead of reporting the note inline.
- `/prune` delegates vault audit to `wiki-lint` and folds its findings into the report.
- `/architecture` and `/define` query the vault for prior patterns/decisions via `wiki-query`.

Without `claude-obsidian` every skill still runs; vault operations are skipped with a one-line note, and `/compound` emits a structured Markdown block the user can capture wherever they like. No hard dependency — install it if it's useful, skip it otherwise.

## Workflow paths

| Task size | Path |
|-----------|------|
| Trivial fix | `/implement` directly |
| Medium feature | `/discovery` → `/implement` |
| Large feature / epic | `/discovery` → `/define` → `/implement` |

## Authoring standard

This plugin ships an authoring standard for creating new skills:

- **Template**: `_templates/SKILL.template.md` — loose skeleton with placeholders
- **Convention doc**: `_templates/AUTHORING.md` — when and how to reference `_shared/` protocols
- **Scaffolder**: `/new-skill` — interactive, generates a conformant `SKILL.md`

Shared protocols live at `_shared/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `handoff-artifact.md` | Five-field structure for cross-phase GitHub issue handoffs |
| `interviewing-rules.md` | One-question-at-a-time interview protocol |
| `notes-md-protocol.md` | In-phase NOTES.md memory tier |
| `compaction-protocol.md` | Context editing → delegation → /compact order |
| `composition.md` | Multi-skill composition patterns, skill roles, and brief contracts |
